Gaussian input file automated

Gaussian calcuation prefers z-matrix coordinates over cartesian. 

In this script pubchemy is used for the molecular structures and it is converted into z-matrix. 
Then gaussian input file is generated ready for gaussian09, gaussian16 and gaussview or more.

Names of the molecules are in the list of "bank" and have to be in IUPAC names.
